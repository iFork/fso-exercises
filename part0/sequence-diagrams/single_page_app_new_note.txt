# 0.6: New note

note over browser
clicking 'Save' button of type "submit" is handled
by JavaScript event handler (onsubmit).
Note that ancestor form has no action and method
attributes. 
end note
note over browser
JS event handler prevents default behavior by `preventDefault()`,
adds note to the notes,
resets the input field, redraws notes,
and initiates HTTP POST to /new_note_spa, setting request header
and sending request with the note data
as JSON string.
end note
browser->server: HTTP POST (to /new_note_spa with form data as JSON per spa.js)
server-->>browser: JSON response ("note created")
